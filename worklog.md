Task: Course sharing fixes — remove "Partager par lien", fix user search, add profile photo upload

Work Log:
- Analyzed uploaded screenshot to understand current UI state
- Explored codebase to find all sharing-related files (ShareCourseDialog, search API, shares API, etc.)
- Read all key files: ShareCourseDialog.tsx, Sidebar.tsx, AppShell.tsx, store.ts, auth routes, Prisma schema
- Removed entire "Partager par lien" section (Section 3) from ShareCourseDialog.tsx including link copy, social sharing buttons, and all related state/imports
- Fixed user search API (/api/users/search) to use case-insensitive raw SQL with LOWER() for SQLite compatibility across firstName, lastName, email, username
- Added avatar field to Prisma User model and ran db:push
- Created new API route /api/users/avatar for profile photo upload (accepts JPEG/PNG/WebP/GIF, max 2MB)
- Updated UserData interface in store.ts to include optional avatar field
- Updated login route to return avatar field in user response
- Updated auth/me route (POST + GET) to include avatar in buildSafeUser and Prisma/raw SQL queries
- Updated Sidebar component: replaced generic User icon with avatar image + camera overlay on hover for photo upload
- Updated AppShell MobileSlideOver: same avatar click-to-upload functionality
- Updated shares list API to include avatar and username in shared user data
- Updated ShareCourseDialog to display avatar images in search results, selected friend, and shared-with list
- Fixed duplicate toast import in AppShell.tsx

Stage Summary:
- "Partager par lien" section completely removed from share dialog
- User search now works with case-insensitive matching across all fields (name, email, pseudo)
- Profile photo upload working: click avatar in sidebar → file picker → upload → display
- Avatar shown in search results and shared-with list (falls back to gradient initial)
- All changes verified via browser testing with agent-browser
- Files modified: ShareCourseDialog.tsx, Sidebar.tsx, AppShell.tsx, store.ts, schema.prisma, users/search/route.ts, users/avatar/route.ts, courses/[id]/shares/route.ts, auth/login/route.ts, auth/me/route.ts, auth/register/route.ts
